# react-colorboxes
An exercise to reenforce understanding React props, defaultProps, state, and simple click events in React.

#### The Goal

For this project, it should show a series of 18 boxes (a box is just square div with a background color).

Initially, each box should have a background color chosen from a random list of colors.

When boxes are clicked, it should change its color to a different random color.

Hereâ€™s some inspiration:
